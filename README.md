# Pets-Classifier-more-classes

Built a Pets classifier which takes an image as an input and predicts breeds of dog/cat.
Built using the Oxford-IIIT dataset of 37 different pet classes. For some reason they did not have Golden retriever , German Shephard, Labrador Retriever as classes so I added those in to the dataset.
Deployed the model on huggingface spaces using Gradio and Git.
The application can be visited and tested here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sarmadahmad8/test1
